# BridgePattern
The Bridge Pattern separates abstraction and implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. It uses an abstraction class that delegates tasks to an implementor interface, enabling flexibility, scalability, and easier code maintenance. This pattern is ideal for scenarios with multiple abstraction-implementation combinations.
