# BridgePattern
# Bridge Pattern

The **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that decouples abstraction from its implementation, enabling them to vary independently. It is ideal for scenarios requiring multiple abstraction-implementation combinations, promoting flexibility and scalability in software design.

## Key Features
- Separates abstraction and implementation into independent hierarchies.
- Encourages code reusability and maintainability.
- Enables independent development and extension of both abstraction and implementation.

## Components
1. **Abstraction**: Defines the interface for higher-level control, delegating operations to the implementor.
2. **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the abstraction interface with additional functionality.
3. **Implementor**: Defines the interface for the implementation hierarchy.
4. **Concrete Implementor**: Implements the `Implementor` interface.

## UML Diagram
```
Abstraction -------> Implementor
     |                    |
RefinedAbstraction   ConcreteImplementor
```

## Example
This repository includes an example of the Bridge Pattern implemented in [your chosen language, e.g., C#, Java, Python].

### Example Use Case
Imagine a scenario where different devices (e.g., TVs, Radios) have similar functionalities like `TurnOn`, `TurnOff`, and `ChangeChannel`. The Bridge Pattern helps decouple the abstraction (remote control) from the implementation (device).

### Code Structure
```
src/
|-- Abstraction.cs
|-- RefinedAbstraction.cs
|-- Implementor.cs
|-- ConcreteImplementor.cs
|-- Main.cs
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bridge-pattern.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bridge-pattern
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   # For C#
   dotnet run

   # For Java
   javac Main.java && java Main

   # For Python
   python main.py
   ```

## Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Abstractions and implementations can evolve independently.
- **Reusability**: Common functionality is reused across different abstractions and implementations.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new abstractions or implementations without affecting existing code.
